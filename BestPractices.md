# Web Development Best Practices  
**Strategic Trading Blueprint – v0.0**

---

## 🧠 Structure & Clarity
- Keep HTML semantic and modular (`<section>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, etc.)
- Use meaningful IDs and classes for future component expansion
- Separate content (HTML), style (CSS), and logic (JS)

## 🎨 Design Consistency
- Use a consistent visual theme across modules (typography, spacing, palette)
- Keep mobile responsiveness in mind from the start
- Maintain high contrast and readability

## 🔧 Code Practices
- Comment critical sections and logic blocks
- Keep CSS DRY with utility classes when possible
- Modularize JavaScript interactions for scalability

## 📁 Git & Versioning
- Commit in logical chunks with descriptive messages
- Follow semver-style tags when moving past v0.0
- Never push broken or unverified code

## 🔍 Testing & QA
- Always preview HTML locally before pushing
- Use browser dev tools for layout/debug validation
- Confirm visual links, anchors, and script loading
